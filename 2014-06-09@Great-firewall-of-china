Recently, I ran into some trouble hosting files in Amazon S3.  Latency reading S3 buckets from china is insanely high.
This is sometimes in excess of 60 seconds to load a given file from S3.

Nothing about the specific file makes the latency high. However, we often time out trying to access these files.  
For anyone who wants to avoid this latency just set up [cloudfront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/). Just do it,
it will be worth the extra couple cents per gigabyte.
 
For your single page application needs give this a try http://www.michaelgallego.fr/blog/2013/08/27/static-website-on-s3-cloudfront-and-route-53-the-right-way/
