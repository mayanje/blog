Recently, I ran into some trouble hosting files in Amazon S3.  Latency into china is insanely high.  
Nothing about the particular files makes the latency high. However, we often time out trying to access these files.  
For anyone who wants to avoid this latency just set up [cloudfront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/). Just do it
it will be worth the extra couple cents per gigabyte.
