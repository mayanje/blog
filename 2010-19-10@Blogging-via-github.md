Blogging software is everywhere these days.  From simple static sites with content bound heavily to html, to highly complex blogging systems like Wordpress with content bound to proprietary formats unreadable in their raw form.As a developer I do all my public activities on github, and that got me thinking. I don't need something complexin order to create blog content.  I just need some [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), and a github account.

This first blog entry is an example of the semantics I will be using for my blog posts within github.  Further entries will follow the following semantics.

1. The 'blog' is represented by a github repo, where master represents the current state of the released blog.
1. New entries will be posted into secondary branches before release and be public but incomplete as I write them.
1. Entries will be raw markdown files with file names of form YEAR-MM-DD@Dash-separated-title.md

If you wish to follow this pattern for yourself checkout README.md for further details.  These will evolve as I utilize this format for my blog.
